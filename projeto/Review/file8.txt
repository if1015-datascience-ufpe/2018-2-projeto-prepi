I love this as a lounge-at-home top. the colors and pattern are really pretty, it's soft and warm. very comfy and cozy. but it's also boxy and thick so not a flattering cut.
I was desperate to find a dress for an upcoming wedding. i basically tired on every dress in the store. this one was by far the best dress i tried on. the outer layer is delicate, and has great stitching and embroidery. the only problem is that the slip is skin tight and too small. this dress is so awesome i'm willing to overlook that and find my own slip. when i came out of the dressing room another couple stopped to tell me how amazing the dress looked. this dress is beautiful!
This skirt is very pretty, but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized, so there's very little stretch. for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements, there's no way to get this skirt on past the hips.
This top is so lovely, i was worried of the color on my pale skin, but it is complementary, nice warm tones. yes, it is a tank, but i can see this as a transition piece into fall with a nice blazer, jeans, boots... the xs regular is perfect for me, length is adequate. if i were to go with petite, i might think it is too short. it is flowy, but still has shape, more than a swing top, so very flattering. the back is really cute too, definitely need a strapless for me, due to the thin straps...
This is such a cute vest. nice and cozy. so cute paired with a long sleeve tee, statement necklace, jeans and booties. very happy with my purchase!
It's beautiful, but more sheer on bottom than it appears in photo. size up.
This shirt looked cute until i tried it on... worst fit ever. im thin, and this style of top is usually quite flattering, but this one missed the mark big time.
This dress is nice, but it won't do for my purpose. i considered it for a mother of the groom dress, but it's not long enough for me. the dress is pretty, but very sheer and very low cut so it would require opaque undergarments. it's not possible to tell from the pictures how sheer this dress is.
Bought this today - cant speak to wear - but overall design is so incredibly cute and flattering. i am usually a small or medium, but went with a medium. so different and wearable! white is sheer so opted for a denimy blue color that i dont see listed available online.
Love the material and style - a very versitile skirt. however, doesn't fit well for those who don't look good in the slimmer looking pencil skirts.
