Love this shirt! i have it in both colors. you can wear it off the shoulder or on. it's baggy enough it looks great with skinny jeans, i recently had a double mastectomy and wore this shirt a lot as it is baggy enough, you couldn't see i had drains underneath my tank top. i am really grateful for this shirt! super soft, super cute!
I saw this top in the store and wanted to try it on but my 18-month-old son was getting cranky so i had to leave. i kept thinking about it and was planning to go back and get it and then i checked online and it was on sale! i purchased the pink and i'm ordering the blue as well. it's very comfortable and i received several compliments when i wore it. i haven't washed it yet but the fabric seems to be sturdy.
I'm 5'8, 130 and a small fits nice. these are different with the silky fabric, pattern and piping - busy but still classy. it is hard to match with a shirt as you need a shorter top so you don't lose too much of the pant's unique design.

It's a casual dress with a luxurious feel. very flowy, but the back panel gives it a bit more structure. i like that it graces my body without showing any lumps. i will very much appreciate it on hot days! i'm anticipating a big of headache when ironing it, but i appreciate that it's not dry clean only. i'm on the shorter side of average height and it hits me mid-thigh.
I have never written a review before, and i love retailer and shop here often. however, i am so unhappy with this shirt i wanted to share to save someone else money. it is such poor quality, it looks thick and flows in the photo, it is very thin and it itches so bad, i could hardly even stand to try it on when it came in the mail. i will deff be taking it back, and do not recommend it at all.
I love this tee. very soft and easy care. gentle cycle hand to dry.
Adorable top! sweet but not too sweet, can go either casual or dressy depending on what it is paired with. i was looking for cropped tops as that silhouette works better for my proportions with the plethora of cropped bottoms that are in stores. as another reviewer mentioned, it is lined so no cami is necessary. the label says dry clean only however, i have washed it in a mesh bag on gentle in cold water and hung to dry without any issues. the dry cleaning warning may be because of the lace on t
