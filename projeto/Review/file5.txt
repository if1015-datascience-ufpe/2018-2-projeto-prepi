I had such high hopes for this top! the colors! the peplum! the ruffles! the price point! the fit was terrible, unflattering, and laughable! please try again with this one, retailer. you could have a real winner with a little tweaking!
I love these pants! i ordered mine in green and retailer definitely offers vanity sizing. but i love them super cute and comfortable. i wish they had more colors available. these were a great buy!
I've only worn the sweater a handful of times, but i'm already in love with how soft and comfortable it is. it's a bit on the baggier side, but that doesn't stop it from looking great. i've gotten complements on it every time i've worn it. i would highly recommend it to people who don't like the typical scratchy/itchy textiles.
This is a pretty dress, but the cut is quite boxy. i had thought that the dress would cut in a bit along the body and then "flare out" more around the waist down to the hem; however, the dress is baggy from the sleeves all the way down, which lends to a rather unflattering look.
I ordered it with a particular outfit in mind as i liked the purple (burgundy) color. ordered xxsp, as with most t-shirts at retailer, they run a little big. xxs seems to be my new xs (which used to be s!).

color was nice , fit was good too, i just felt not "special" enough... but if you are looking for a tshirt, then i say give it a try, as it was comfortable and the shape at least is unusual.

for reference, 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist

I ordered a large and despite wearing a large in many other items from antrhopologie, this item was too small, especailly across the bust. it was very well-made and the color green is beautiful, but unfortunately, i will not be able to wear it. so disappointed.
Great design, beautiful colors, well fitted. got compliments.
This shirt was strange. the bow tie was too thin and the dots were too dominant on the shirt. it looks okay in the model picture, but when i tried it on the bow and the dots just clashed.
