I really like this piece; the fit is great, the double zipper falters and cinched waist and 3/4 sleeves flatter. i will say, it's pricey for what it is (a cardigan) - but it's a great, versatile closet staple.
Love this dress! it is so comfortable and can be worn as casual or dress up.
Love the simple, casual elegance of this coat. i especially love the colors, grey & beige, because it looks great with my grey jeans as well as my dressier beige pants. i will get a lot of use from this coat.
I tried on the xs in store (would need xxs i think, it is short enough to not need petite). anyway, the neck part was really bunching up on me (between neck and girls), it wasn't flattering. the rest of the tank is really pretty and flattering though, but the bunching was enough for me to leave it behind. the fabric is soft, and the color is nice warm neutral. i love the lace back with the subtle layer of satiny looking fabric. overall goo, perhaps i don't have the right shoulder shape fr this.
I purchased this blazer in both striped versions for work. it's basically a blazer/sweatshirt hybrid!

while it does run true to size, i can wear a small or medium in retailer; i purchased medium in this. don't size down if your size is ambiguous!


Love this top! the length is perfect and it is very stylish! hope it will come in other colors because i would buy more!!
I was very excited about receiving this dress. unfortunately i was a little disappointed when i opened the package, as the color was darker than on the picture.
i live in florida where the sun is always shining and although this dress has a beautiful simple design, it isn't for me as the color is too "winter".
Since there isn't one where i live, i ran into retailer while waiting for my daughter to pick me up. saw this and bought it off the rack w/out trying on. had to get a m as they were out of s, and yes, it's a tad large on me, but still glad i got it. i think it will be a nice transition piece into fall in hot texas. love how the linen drapes and it makes me feel a bit more dressed up than a cotton tee. the ruching on the sleeves is an extra nice touch.
