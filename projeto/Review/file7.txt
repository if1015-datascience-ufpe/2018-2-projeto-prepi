This top has nice quality lace but the layout is strange! it wouldn't stay under my boobs but kept creeping up and looked strange! not for girls with a chest!
I stumbled upon this dress yesterday at the store and fell in love with it! i wore it today with boots and received tons of compliments. it is light, comfortable and flattering. i love that it is machine washable, too!
These jeans are adorable! i'm so sad they didn't fit. my legs are bigger than the rest of my body, but i usually have good luck with wide leg pants. if you are looking for wide legs, these are not the jeans for you!
Precious tee, washes well, runs large
This is a classic, well made, velvet top. it fits true to size, is very flattering ,the on- line photos don't do it justice. very pretty in real life. 34a 123 lbs ordered the xs.
Bought this on a whim and it exceeded my expectations. i didn't know what to expect with the quality of the fabric but this is incredibly soft and warm. haven't worn it outside yet but i can see this already as one of my favorite items. i'm usually an extra-small but the xxs also fits. it's a great buy especially since it's on sale now.
Gorgeous color (plum) and is very comfy. the lace at the top is just enough to be feminine, but not too much to be trashy.

I absolutely fell in love with the design of this dress! the colors and cut are easy to wear but unique enough to stand out. i was between the medium and the small and ultimately went with the medium. the dress hits right above my knee, fits nicely at my waist, and is well made. the top does seem a bit loose (as pictured on the model) but i prefer a slightly more fitted look. a padded bra would probably have filled out the extra fabric but it was an easy alteration and will allow me to wear the
I love this dress! there are so many different looks you can get just by adjusting the straps or shoulders. the material is lightweight and flows with every turn. i ordered my usual size 10 and it fits perfectly. i did need a little assistance in getting the side zip to go up, but once it was on i didn't want to take it off.
I bought these pants on a whim while i was at my local retailer. i was so delighted after trying them on because i've never tried on a pair of linen pants that i actually liked. they definitely have more of a flair leg rather than straight leg like the picture suggests. i wore them for several hours at a party and they didn't stretch that much on me. i agree with the other review in that they do get a little wrinkly but not much more than what i would expect from linen fabric. i'm 5'3" so t
