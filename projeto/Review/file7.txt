I adore this dress.
the fabrics are elegant and unique and combine for a stunning look!
tried with a belt and looks wonderful with or without......so many options.
perfect dress for warm autumn days!
ordered my usual size and fits very true to size.
a must have!
I was really happy when i saw this romper online and ordered it right away. unfortunately being larger chested i thought i would size up to a medium. bad choice. now i have a beautiful romper that is too big for me. i will be getting this one tailored.
I love this top, it is a very soft material and it looks very classy.. i have worn it with a skirt for work and skinny jeans. i have a bigger bust and i wear a small, it is true to size. very classy!!
Don't be fooled by the photos online. the color is a bright baby blue, not pale blue. it's a beautifully designed dress, however, the material is so bulky and heavy. it's so unflattering. i was afraid to try it on and my fears came true: this dress just hung on me and pulled me down. i wanted so much to love it, but i returned it.
I have always bought interesting, pretty, wearable dresses for my daughters at retailer. now the dresses are just retro funky. sad to see.
This sweater is very warm yet light. the pink color is very cute, and the buttons are detailed very nicely! it hangs a bit low under the arms, and definitely tightens at the wrist. i ordered the xs size, and i find that i am unable to push the sleeves up. this is so beautiful and has a subtle uniqueness.
These are really nice pants - color and style are perfect but when i first put them on they seemed like they fit perfectly on me then within 30 minutes they looked 2 sizes too big - they got loose due to the material not being firm or thick enough. i would go down a size for sure. the cons aren't unsolvable so try them out!
They're the same quality and fit as my hyphens from last year. easy purchase!
I found this tee to run true to size with a comfortable relaxed fit. the neckline and elegant button gives this tee enough detail to dress it up if you wanted to take it in that direction.
I love this top! i actually didn't read the reviews prior and ordered a small. the retailer tag on mine says small, but the tag in the shirt is xs. it does run large, so the mix-up was fine by me. the style of the shirt is meant to be loose and light. i love it.
