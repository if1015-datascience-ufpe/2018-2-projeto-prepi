This sweater is super cute and i so wish it worked for me. i am but i must like sweaters a little longer than everyone else because this just hit me at the wrong place. if you're still trying to work off that last little bit of your baby bump, even 2 years removed, this hits right there and emphasizes your waist, at least on me and i'm 5'5". it's so cute that i might have kept it to see if i could get it to work for me but it still has the ink tag on it so it has to be returned no matter what an
The skirt is lovely, has beautiful colors , and the touch of lace takes it to that ultra feminine level. it's a lot of skirt---yards of material and i like that it is fully lined, but this creates a problem, the source of the only negative thing i have to say about it. the only criticism i have is with the waistband---it's much too flimsy to stay up on the waist because of the weight of the skirt. i had my seamstress add a heavier weight elastic band inside the one it has or the skirt would star
I fell in love with this sweater as soon as i saw it. i was a little unsure what the quality would be like just from the photos, but i went ahead and ordered it and it is even more amazing in person. it's super soft and well made. it's also very warm even though it has such a large open weave. the price is definitely higher than i would normally pay, but this is a piece that will stay in your closet, and wardrobe rotation for years and years. definitely worth the investment. i agree with the pre
First of all, the photo online doesn't really do the colors of this skirt justice. it is a heathered knit, with colors of white, gold (deep yellow), raspberry (or almost maroon), and teal. i have never seen a color combo like this before, and its really fun. i am wearing it today with a burgundy color sweater, but i anticipate being able to match it for summer with any of those colors i just mentioned, or even navy or tan. the skirt has a lining in it, and the wide ribbed knit runs at varying an
I saw this dress online and immediately went to the store to try on! it took three sales asscoaites to help me zip the dress but once it was on it was beautiful! the bodice fits really nicely. true to size. there was extra fabric around the waist bust nothing that made the fit look weird. love love love!!! wearing for christmas eve!
Fantastic quality. i agree the material is heavier and may be too hot for summer in sc but will be perfect for ac cooled offices. the fit is tts. i am smaller on top than the bottom and size 2 fit well everywhere thanks to the somewhat stretchy material, 32-24-36. i never write reviews but this dress really is fantastic and at a great price point given the high quality of the fabric and design. i couldn't tell from the pics but the back bottom is not a single center slit but a double slit. i rea
These pants are so soft and stretchy they feel like leggings. i love the ankle length as they are perfect to wear with both flats and booties. i am 5'5" with fairly long legs and these hit right at my ankle. they are so comfortable i have ordered in the green, red and gray. my "go to" pants this winter.
Love this dress! fits tts. great fitted slip underneath beautiful lace design. i'm 5'6" the dress (size small), hits right above my knees. very versatile dress, may be dressed up or down depending on shoes
This worked for me, very elegant, cozy and comfortable.
These run a tiny bit large, but i'm still keeping them. they are so soft and comfortable!
