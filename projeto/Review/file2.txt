This is beautiful on. it flatters the figure nicely. the material is a rougher cotton which seems oppressive for summer even though thin. it is very low cut but it looks wonderful.
So comfortable and warm! so nice to lounge in a cold day and be cute!
Love this dress! runs big though, size down
I fell in love with this blouse the minute i saw it in the store. the colors are a little deeper than how they appear in the catalog, but the greens and browns are beautiful and will be great for fall! it fit very true to size, i usually wear 8-10, and the m fit perfect. the gold beading on the sleeves and neck are a nice extra! love this top!!
I am so glad i did not wait to order this dress. the fit is great and is made with great material. i am 5' 7", 110 lbs and ordered a 0. often i have to have a dress altered but it is not the case with this dress. the length falls right at my knee. it is not shown in the photos of the dress but it has a buttoned back slit that has two buttons with a bright orange trim along the slit. a very cure feature. the bright blue back drop is hard to see on the photos as well but is nice.
This sweater looks great with chambray colored denim. i wear it with jeans, shift dresses and even leggings. definitely one of my go to sweaters for the fall.
Little clack dress. classic shape but is pretty low in the v neck. i am busty (34dd) and need a "push-up" bra to make the neckline close. it's very easy to wear and super comfy.
Really like this dress but.....
the dress is lined in a heavy fabric and weighs a lot for a summer dress
worst of all there is no chance at all of getting the buttons through the button holes.
impossible!
has to go back
This a a great sweater! it is classic, but has the fun surprise element of the lace bell sleeves. loved it so much i got the black and the sea mist. looks great with jeans or leggings! the only negative is you can call it that is that the sleeves are a tad long for me. compliments everytime i wear!
These didn't work for me because i am too straight shaped for these jeans. try them if you have a smaller waist and curvy hips and bottom! i didn't have anything to fill out the hips and seat. for reference, i ordered size 25, and they were loose in hip and seat, but fit my waist. my hips are 34.5" and waist is 28". they are a thinner stretch denim than they appear, but not jeggings thin.
