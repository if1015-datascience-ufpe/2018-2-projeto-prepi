This jacket is extremely soft and comfortable, with a heavier textured fabric. i think it is expensive for what it is--$138--probably best to wait for a sale
I ordered bought a medium for a comfortable fit. the material is stretchy, so size down for a body - hugging fit.
This will be my favorite fall acquisition! looks better in person. very flattering. does run large. love the combo of tan and grey.
These shorts are just beautiful. with that said, they were expensive, but made reasonable when i snagged them in the online sale! they do also run large, and they seem to be made for short-waisted bodies. i will be bringing them back to my local store to (hopefully) exchange for a smaller size. fingers crossed that they still have them in stock!
This is a beautiful dress. the dress is a lighter blue when compared to the picture, and the fabric is thick but the shape is beautiful. the waist is very fitted but it didn't feel uncomfortable. i didn't think the fabric was itchy as others mentioned. i do think it is a bit short on the front (it is a high low dress), but at 5'4" that is not a problem for me. it was true to size for me (135 lbs, 34c).

I bought this shirt in a size 10. i am a 32 4d and it fit perfect, but wanted it to fit flowy as it does on the model...so sizing up to a 12. very nice quality fabric...not sure how it will be after it's washed. looks just like the picture. i bought the ivory color.
This top really is lovely. i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans. i wash everything before i wear it. though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned, there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned. so i hand washed it with delicate soap. when the lighter colors came into contact with the black, the black immediately stained the light color. i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains, rinsed and hung it above my bath tub. it is cur
