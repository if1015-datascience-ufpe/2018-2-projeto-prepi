Love the pattern play on this skirt! i had to size up to a 6 (i usually take a 2 or 4 in skirts) as it was too snug in the hips/waist. going up a size worked well and the hem hit me at the knee (i'm 5' 6"). thought it looked cute with the cloth & stone chambray tank :)
I ordered this in the white in my usual size 26, and these were too big on me (5'5", 110lbs). the pants bunched up unattractively around my thighs because they were not form-fitting. i am hoping to exchange for the size 25 because i prefer a tighter fit. the style of the pants were very cute. i like the side slit detail and the cropped look. i'm hoping these pants work out for me in the smaller size.
As far as t-shirts go, this one is fun, i love the lace up detail in the back. the xs regular fit nicely (115 lbs, 30dd), the shirt flares out (swing), so it can be a little much on the smaller gals, but it was ok enough on me that the stylist decided to try it on too. the orange color was pretty, but i decided to pass as i have a lot of orange tops... and that is the color that was most flattering on my skin. amterial is on the thinner side and a little tiny sheer, must be the trend...
Love the cutouts and embroidered detail of this top. it swings away from the body due to the crisp cotton drape. perfect for summer!
My sister gave me this top for christmas and it's perfect. i find myself grabbing for it constantly. i'm usually an xsp and the xxs fits me perfectly. i wear it with leggings and jeans.
I did not realize that this knitted vest had an attached gauzy under-layer. i can see it now in the photo, but i just thought it wasn't part of the actual vest. when the vest arrived i realized sadly that this flowing under-layer was part of the design. i don't know why because the yarn and vest are lovely without it. in my opinion, the under-layer takes away from the beautiful vest. i guess i could have spent some time and removed it, but at that price i just sent it back. too bad because the m
These pants are so great. very comfortable, true to size, and i can see myself wearing these all spring and summer. i'm 5'1, 120 lbs, and my usual 26 petite fit great. these would also make excellent travel pants. i purchased the green color, and will be purchasing the tan color once i get done writing this review.
This dress is just beautiful - color, fit, length, style, stretchy fabric...everything about it seems to flatter all body types. it also passes the armhole test - no issues there! the back closure detail adds a little something special to it. i tried it on with black leggings and a black leather jacket just for fun, and it looks surprisingly cute for multi-season wear. is it overpriced? absolutely, but so is 99% of the stuff at retailer. i will be keeping it anyway though because i think it's a tr
Nice fabric and construction. the small fit me, a usual size 6. only problem: there is no way to easily use the bathroom in this thing! seriously. that's why i'm returning it.
Easy to wear, get lots of compliments when i wear it. can be dressed up or down
