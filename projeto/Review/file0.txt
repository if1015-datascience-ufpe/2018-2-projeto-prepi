I have never taken the time to write a review but i was so disappointed by this dress. the design is cute and i got the medium instead of a small (i'm normally a 4/6) and i wanted to make sure it was a bit looser and below the knee. that was a good call because the fit is comfy and cute belted. however, it is so very thin and see through. i was looking forward to a cool, cotton dress for summer but this will definitely require a full slip if i decide to keep it. it came with no slip at all so th
This is so soft and has wonderful drape. i want to love it. it is not gold. not in my opinion anyway. the "gold" parts look like muted lime green to me. it's true to size and looks similar to the picture otherwise. i just don't know about that color- especially on me.
I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering.   the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made.  however, this shirt is so unstructured and oversized, i might as well worn a brown paper bag.
I just received my dress yesterday and it is gorgeous!!! i actually ordered 2 sizes, 00p and 0p, depending on some cuts i'm between those 2 sizes, i am 5'1 92 lbs but with holidays eating i have gained 4 pounds so far, so the 00p was bit too tight all way from hips to bust area, i was able to zip it up but was a bit painful to keep breathing and got some weird wrinkles on the back between waist line and derriã©re.
the dress is a beautiful cocktail of sexy curvy silhouette with the baroque flavor
Great causal tank! the back is a bitter longer than the front - i'm 5'6" and the back-model shot was right on for where it his me at the hip/butt. the material is a poly/spandex/rayon mix that feels predominately like polyester and rayon and has a little bit of give.

 i go between a medium and small in most retailer tanks and like to achieve a look that is somewhere in between form-fitting and flowy (quick stats - 130 lbs, 34c) and the small was perfect without being too tight across the chest.
I tell everyone i know to try these jeans, that they are so worth the price tag. i've been an ag super fan for years, but i fell in love with paige the moment i tried these on. (i still love ag for their colored and patterned ankle denim and cords.) i have worn these over 50 times without ever having to wash them. (i never understood the idea that you're not supposed to wash denim, but now i realize that it's feasible.) they don't stretch out and still hug me like a second skin - without feeling
I liked the colors and the design but it's kind of an odd fabric, no give at all and no drape. stiff and kind of structured feeling for a casual cardigan. the sleeves are extremely narrow and tight. i ordered a medium and it felt like a ace bandage squeezing my arms. my arms are normal sized. if you have exceptionally narrow arms, might work for you. sending it back.
Love the detail of this top; however, it runs large and had no shape on me
I like design of the dress, softness and color ( i got grey), the dress is shorter on me then on model ( 5'6" 145 lbs) i got m fits ok but i don't like fabric quality it seems like it can be peeled and picks up everything and needs to be sprayed all the time. despite i got it with 40% discount it will come back as it's poor quality.
This dress is beautiful and fit exactly as pictured. i'm 5'9", 140 lbs and a size 4 fit perfectly.
