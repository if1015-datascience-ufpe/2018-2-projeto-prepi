First let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress. but the fit is extremely loose. they could take out an entire 12 inches of material and it would still be a swing dress. the photo of the back of the model, where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate. if it was, i would love this dress. the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs - straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline. i am 5'7"
Comfortable and great fit and color. high quality.
I love these pants - they are very soft but the linen is thick and high-quality.

Beautiful warm vest. originally bought small but had to exchange for extra small. i love that it reversible and has a hood.
Love the warm color and soft fabric - paired with chic tights and ankle boots and it fits right into a more casual workplace.
I was lucky enough to hit retailer day in san diego and snagged this little number - it is truly better looking in person. the dress hugs in all the right places and actually fits tighter than the model shows, but the material is that soft, but stretchy and gently molds to the shape of your body. i was really surprised, i would have never tried this dress from the photo shown. so glad i went in - it's really adorable!
Super comfortable top. easily washable, 2 options with the sleeves, and a nice drape to the fabric. truly a go-anywhere top.
I purchased this dress in my regular size small as soon as i saw it pop up on-line and found it to be tts (34d-27-35), it hits just to my knee (i'm 5'4") and it actually reminds me of the way maeve's devery dress looks and fits which is really, really nice. i'm finding this dress by floreat to also be quite slimming and the embroidery and colors set against the black is just absolutely gorgeous! the material is super soft, the v-neck isn't too low and i love the pockets so i'm very happy with my
I got this dress in the mail today, and it's one of the best dresses i've ever gotten at retailer.. the material is of high quality and feels silky against the skin. the fit is true to size for maeve, and is so flattering. for reference, i'm thin (116 lbs), but curvy and usually order a regular xs. in maeve, i'm usually an xsp, and the xsp fit perfectly. it looks good with a wide cream colored crocheted belt (also from retailer), or on its own.
