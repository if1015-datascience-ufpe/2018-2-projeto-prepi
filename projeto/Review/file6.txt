I live in south florida so i'm always looking for sundresses that will be flattering (but not too clingy or hot), and that i can take from day to evening with accessories. when i pulled this out of the box and walked around in it, it met all my criteria, and as an added bonus, my husband said, "wow! you look great! where'd you get that dress?" i'm shocked because as an earlier reviewer said, this dress doesn't seem like much - it's not even lined. but it's comfy, flattering (in all the right pla
It's a nice drop-waist, embroidered, lightweight dress for summer. my problem was that the armholes were too large for me and i found that to be unflattering. it's a swing style so it's forgiving in the hips and belly.
I loved this the minute i saw it in the store but left without buying it.  i called the store an hour later and asked them to hold it for me so i could get it the next day. :)

i love it.  it's still a little too warm to wear it in nyc yet but i will soon. i'm thinking 40-50's is the perfect temps for it.  

i rarely say this but i don't think the photos of the coat above do it justice.
I loved this top so much i bought both colors! soft and warm without being too thick or bulky.
This tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed. but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it.
Great staple item. i have it in multiple colors and like them all. easy to add statement necklace to change up the look. wear it under cardi or jacket to make it not look 'tent' like.
Got this on a whim and boy i'm very pleased! it's flattering and the material is perfect for spring weather. size up as mentioned by other reviewers.
I was thrilled to find this in a store to try it on. the fabric is light weight and the cut of the sleeves make it very unique. my only gripe is the length. it hits the very top of my pants. so if you lift your arms in any way because of the cut of the sleeves - the whole shirt lifts up and shows belly. but i loved the elegance of it so much i decided that i can live with the shortness. i will just wear a tucked in cami underneath. this fit true to size.
I fell in love with this dress when i saw it in the catalog and was so bummed to see it on backorder online until may! i went to my local store and they had it in stock so i immediately tried it on. i'm not usually a big fan of maxi dresses but this dress is so pretty and the quality is amazing! the fabric is light and airy but not too delicate and the subtle beading on the top adds an extra special touch. the waist is a little high (it's similar to the picture online) but i'm also 5'10 so it mi
I couldn't wait to try on these shorts after reading all the positive reviews about them. my local retailer had them in the bright blue and coral in my size 26 and 25. i purchased the 26 and am content with them. they are a very lightweight cool pair of shorts. they do have a little stretch to them and the length is perfect.. i have to note they do wrinkle a bit but perfect summer staple. .
