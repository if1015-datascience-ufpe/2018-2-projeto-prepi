If it's a knock off, its of the "poise" dress, and a pretty good one at that. this is a beautiful dress that took my breath away the moment i saw it. when i saw such a poor rating i just had to see why. the erin fetherston dress is over $100 more and they look just about the same. i'd rather have the $ and the look!
I ordered these in a size small on sale, thinking that because of the material, they might not fit. they are actually very cute, and fit in the waist/legs, but in the crotch area, as another reviewer mentioned, they could fit a little better. they look fine with a longer top so i decided to keep them.
I love the look of this sweater and was so happy with how it looked and felt when i first tried it on, but within a day of wear, i noticed significant pilling, which made it appear much older / worn.
I absolutely love this top, especially for fl weather.
it's soft and falls just a tad longer in the back and is a little fitted in the bust area with a very feline look.
i had the tank as well and just love the satin trim!
i will say it runs a little smaller than the tank bc i have xs in the tank and needed a small in this!
love it!
I read the reviews and because this jacket is pilcro i took a chance. i was thrilled when i rceived this jacket. darker color of denim with weathered edges. i absolutely love it. don't let it get away. great jean jackets are hard to come by.
These pants look nice and they are comfortable too! the relaxed fit isn't sloppy, and the colors are great.
This top was fun. casual with flair. it is a little strange that it is see through down to the stomach almost, but i would just wear a bra of the same color and don't think anyone would notice.  i didn't buy because even the sale price is too much for a casual tee, in my opinion.

The material is very soft and it looks just like it does on the model with the exception that it gets a little wrinkly at the hem and turns up at the corners. i like it and have already worn it a few times.
Love this coat - great fall piece! i bought the green color and it looks as shown in the picture. great retailer purchase!
