I believe that this sweater is by moth and not knitted and knotted as noted in the description. for me, this tunic was just ok. i didn't think that the quality was great and it just didn't wow me, especially at this price point.
This is an oversized tee with a somewhat flattering fit. material is very thin. i ordered white, which was completely see-through. not at all what i was expecting. might work better in a darker color, but i returned it since it was nothing special.
I worry when i have an elastic waist, or something that resembles this, but the dress hangs like a dream.
no puffing out, no gathers that you can see.
it is not sheath, but not a line either, kind of in between, hits several inches above my knees, but perfect with some black tights for winter. i saw the note about grey, have to try it on agin in daylight, but i would say think black on the top, light camel color on the bottom
i am 5'8, typically wear a size 12, and it was true to size for me

I ordered a size large and it's so big i couldn't tell how it would look in a smaller size. the waist cinched but there's too much fabric in the hips to be slimming. the floral pattern is beautiful with light blue and lavender flowers that are generic enough to match with a variety of colors on top. it's too long for my frame. the slip falls above knee so it's sheer from there down. i decided not to try a smaller size but recommend going down one or even two sizes.

I ordered these leggings and loved them, for about an hour- at which point the belt loop ripped off of the pant, leaving a hole. i called customer service and they sent me a 2nd pair. same thing happened. i never even pulled on the belt loop. they are just so flimsy. it's a shame bc they are cool looking.
Bought this dress on sale - i haven't decided if i'm going to keep it yet or not, because i'm not sure if it's flattering to my bubble butt. i normally wear a 6-8 in retailer (5'6" 135 lbs thin limbs 38-26-38). i ordered this dress in a size 4 regular and i find the length perfect with flats or with heels. i also find the bust area, waist and hips accommodating without being tight, which usually never happens. for this current sale price, this is a gorgeous dress made with beautiful material.
This is really my favorite top! i wear it all the time, like every day. it's so soft, a beautiful rich color (blue), has nice detailing, and so flattering on a hot momma like me who still has a little tummy from my three lovely children. snuck it in to my dressy office on a friday as well - with a conservative skirt and high heels. only downside is the lack of other nice colors. the stripe isn't cutting it. got my regular xs and it fits perfectly.
I love the lace on this top, it's perfect. it's great for my shape, i'm
so happy with this purchase.
This has a heftier fabric than seems to be in the picture online. i wish it were the same fabric as the fringed chambray dress. that, coupled with it being cut very generously, and the hip placement of the bulky pocket fabric, causes it to look quite thick and dumpy unless you pin your elbows in to show where your waist is.  i usually wear a 4-6, and bought the 2. i'm returning it for a 0 petite and see how that goes.  i love it, so i'm hoping that causes the fit to appear more as it does on the
