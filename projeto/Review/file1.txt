I love this flirty, well fitted dress! quality material!
The stress is a simple basic. i got it in the navy stripe and have worn it with the long gray scarf, similar to pictured. it is very soft and comfortable.
Am typically a size 0 and could barely get the extra small on, which is a first. was very cute in theory, but i'd suggest sizing up (maybe 2x).
Another cloth and stone success! love the back! denim goes with most anything!
Loved this online and even better in person. inner lining is like a cozy sweatshirt!
Love this top! cloth & stone makes excellent quality clothes that are durable and have unique details. this top can go with many different looks and i can't wait to take it out for a spin!

i bought the medallion crops to go with this top and it is an awesome combo, i would definitely check it out!
This dress is so simple, but gorgeous on. the top runs a bit small in the shoulders/bust. the top button gapes a bit in the bust area. the cuffs and collar insides are a different coordinating print and provides a cute option to roll or unbutton and press open to style.
Finally decided to join the yoga-wear craze and thought these tights and a few other pair from retailer would help me transition to this style. my size l tights were just that -- tight! so tight, i really didn't want to pull them up past the knee!! i am not kidding. i wear size 14 pants and my legs are toned and shapely, so there was no reason to expect a l wouldn't fit. so sad.
I picked this up this weekend. so gorgeous! i usually don't do maxi length. at 5'3" it can be overwhelming. but this is so flattering! this is floor length on me. i picked up a couple tops at another store because the suggested sweaters were just too baggy for my frame. i'll pair it with a cream blouse (pictured) to dress up and a pink crepe blouse and denim jacket for a more casual look. i'm usually a 4 and the small fits perfectly.
Wore this to my sons wedding. found it last minute when i had changed my mind about another byron lars dress. i felt awesome in it and got many compliments
