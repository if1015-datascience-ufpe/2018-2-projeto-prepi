Easy to wear! cute, comfy...will be a go to for summer.
I absolutely love the look and fit of these pants. what is even better is that they don't stretch out while wearing them. i will get a lot of use out of them!
I love this skirt!! i'm trying to find the perfect place to wear it :)
Ag is my go-to brand for comfortable, high quality jeans. these fit the bill!
Great cut & fit! the length is perfect, too. i like the weight of the skirt overall. good for all seasons.
I love, love, love this skirt. it's comfortable and attention getting. i receive compliments whenever i wear it -- and i feel great wearing it. colors are much more vivid than on the website -- that's a plus!
Runs small in the chest, so don't order if you are large chested! over all, very cute.
Just bought this today in xl and i like it a lot. i am very busty so if i see an xl in most things i will try it on. i probably could have fit into a large though. this will look cute with leggings as it is long enough to cover your butt. i didn't know about the emerald color as it looked in store lights, but it is more blue-green at home. i like it even better. well worth $48!
I love this skirt. i was happy with the quality of the fabric and style. i originally ordered a small, but returned and exchanged for a medium, which fits great. (i typically wear a size 6-8 in pants). i look forward to wearing this skirt to work this fall.
Great shirt!! i bought the red penguins and its adorable. i am returning it however b/c the size i bought was too big, with that said it was my error not the brand. i think it runs true to size.
