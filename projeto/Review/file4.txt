This is a charming dress, with lots of quality touches, and something which is easy to wear and appropriate for many occasions. however, the dress i received wasn't quite like the dress pictured in the catalog and main website photos. the bottom buttons of the over-dress do not have matching holes, so you can't button it. this makes the v lower, and the bodice looser. it is like the photo with the brunette model on the website, rather than the primary photos with the blonde lady. personally, i w
This skirt is so light and breezy perfect for hot or humid weather. the first time i wore it i got compliments all day long. the length is perfect for a more conservative look, i don't wear mini skirts and the slit on the side shows just the right amount of leg. it runs a bit large so i had to go down a size.
This is better than the original tla t shirts from last summer. better quality/not sheer. great fit! i bought both the white and the purple. love tla tees!
These pants are a fun way to mix it up from the usual dark, solid colored pants. the print is a perfect balance between subtle and bold. the fabric is soft and stretchy and i love that these pants are washable. i i'm petite (5'2") but my petite size was sold out so i bought these pants in the regular length. they are soooo long that i think even the petite size wouldn't have ended up cropped on me. having said that, i like them enough that i plan to keep them and have them shortened. i usually s
I bought this in the pattern in a size medium. i am a size 4-6 (38" around the hips/butt). the small fit but felt very clingy to my curves. the medium gave me a little more wiggle room and didn't outline every curve of my butt. the material is very soft and comfortable, but it didn't feel thin or cheap or see-through. it has a nice weight to it. i am tall (almost 5' 9") and it fit me just as it appears in the picture.
Had to return for a larger size. like the design, though. quality wasn't as expected but since i purchased on sale, i decided not to return the top but exchange for a larger size which i hope is still available.
I saw this t on sale and ordered it. i had second thoughts, thinking it would be just like a lot of ts i already have. well, i got it today and am thrilled. the fabric is so soft, a sumptuous softness that makes me feel good. the fit is the fit we all want in a great t, nice fit, not too baggy, not too tight, and it is so flattering. it doesn't show off my tummy as so many other ts do. i can wear this with jeans or a skirt. so glad i got it!

This sweater is beautiful but runs large all over. i ordered a m and returning for a small. hopefully that works.
