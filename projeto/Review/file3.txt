These pants are super comfy and fit true to size. i went up to a size large because i wanted them extra roomy and longer. i'm 5'10" and 140lbs and generally wear a size 6-8 in pants. i highly recommend them for stylish and comfy lounge pants!
Love this dress!! i layer spanx and a seamless tank underneath, as the fabric would show everything if worn on it's own.
I tried these on to compare with a different style and didn't like this one a much (also ag brand). these fit better at the waist, but seemed long on me and made me look frump ear. i think they are really comfortable, adn on the longer legs would be great. buy f you are taller than 5 foot 1.5 inches:-). (reference, i am 115 lbs and tried on the 25)
Beautiful blouse. i bought this in cream. runs tts. can wear with jeans, skirts etc. love front and back! very flattering arms.
Nice quality material. the green is pretty color. just a good cozy top. i normally wear a large in retailer clothes and the large in this world was very roomy (which was fine with me). if you are short and have smaller shoulders and bust definitely go for a size smaller than you would normally wear.
This dress is stunning- vibrant colors and flirty feel to it. i got the small and i am a 34b/27 pants, 132 lbs- great fit. i only question two things- am i tall enough to pull off the extra fabric in the back and what the heck do you where for a bra? those two considerations are why i didn't give it 5 stars.
I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer. the shirt in our store was featured in all colors.  i chose the burnt orange color to try on and it is was incredibly soft!  i felt like i was wearing a t-shirt with an easy on and easy off feel. the flow of the shirt allows you to wear out or tuck in.  i paired with teal velvet crops and tucked the shirt in for more structure to the outfit. love!!!
Absolutely lovely dress, in a gorgeous color, drapes well. the perfect blend of pretty and sexy. so much more beautiful in person!
I love this dress! easy breezy flowy comfortable & pink! fits a true medium ...would recommend to anyone. makes me a little flirty!
I really wanted to like this shirt, but it made me look 9 months pregnant. which would be fine if i were pregnant.  it sits wired in the bust and flows out in the front and back. not flattering at all.
