This is a cool relaxed style with the benefit of an open neckline to add a bit of femininity. i tried on the faded blue and striped colors in the store. the faded blue goes well with the style, but the stripe is cute too. the sleeves are quite long and too tight to roll up, so if you are petite like me you will definitely want to order the petite size- and probably even those you who are in between petites and regular sizes. the sleeves may also be too narrow for some people.
After seeing this on anthto's facebook page i was so excited to order. i ended up going to a store and trying on. i couldn't believe it was the same shirts when i first saw it. i thought this ran quite big. and the shape was odd. lots of material in the middle. i am a mom of 3 young kids and didn't want people to think #4 was on the way.
This is such a great work wear piece for me. it's form flattering, well constructed, comfortable and truly elegant. this is probably my 5th or 6th dress from the moulinette soeurs line and i am consistently impressed with the quality and wearability of these clothes.

This cute dress highlights some trouble spots and emphasizes good parts too, so i'm happy but not ecstatic.  for myself, the sleeves are tight and  so is the fit across the back and shoulders.  sizing up makes the voluminous skirt overwhelming.  the skirt is already a lot to handle in my regular size.  the good part is the pattern, swingy silhouette and it covers my tummy.  i have thick arms, wide bust, round back and meaty shoulders.  140# 5'3" 36d and purchased size 10.

Would be flattering on someone who is slim with all the right curves. i'm average size and a mother of 3. the medium was not a true medium. the fabric was amazing. the arm holes were too open/low cut for my taste. 
i'm 5'7" and 140. this landed mid calf. not my preference. 

retailer accepted the return with a hassel free refund all under 2 weeks from receiving it.
I tried this on in the store and the colors and fabric are terrific. it's very light-weight fabric but isn't see-through. the colors are medium in depth, not too bright. if you typically wear "cool" colors and avoid browns, you may be able to wear this because the brown is very muted. there's two strings inside that you tie around your waist to pull the bust of the dress in. i'm 5'4" and 125 lbs, so there's simply too much fabric in the dress. i would have bought a petite. the tag says it's avai
I read the reviews and everyone loved them so ordered them online. for me, they are a no. i thought the fabric was cheap and the quality not so great compared to typical retailer items.
I almost always return dresses after trying them at home but not this one! i love it and can't wait to get it back from the dry cleaner. the shoulders are really stylish and the dress is super comfortable. it has pockets which is also a bonus.  i told my husband that i want to bring it to a seamstress and have it duplicated in another fabric because i love it so much.
This top is super cute, nice and light for the hot weather, with a tts fit. the model is wearing a light-colored bra, so it shows through. but, with a black bra, there is no problem.
