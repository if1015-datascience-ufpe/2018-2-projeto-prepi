This shirt looked plain online, but when i see it in store, i thought it's so pretty! it is the over-sized style, when i tried it on, it's so flattering, even though it is over-sized but it doesn't make you look chunky at all! i got it while it was on sale with extra 25% off! i range from 2 to 6, xs, s for retailer sizes. i got a xs for this top.
I tried on this top in the ivory color in the store, but i didn't need another ivory-colored top, so i passed it up. however, i kept thinking about the pretty details, especially trim on the sleeves, so when i saw it online in the red color, i ordered it. i was surprised when it arrived with how thin and sheer the fabric is (the soft flowy mini-pleated body of the shirt; the other sections are flat cotton, which is more sturdy). i hadn't noticed this when i tried on the ivory version! but i'm ke
I love these pants! comfortable, light and can be dressed up for work and down for the weekend. the color is a little more saturated in person, but can't really complain about that too much!
I wish this dress was more fitted.. the dress looks more fitted and more vibrant in the picture. i bought this dress in an xs, but i am not sure that going smaller would take care of the amount of material in this dress. it was shapeless and did not fall as nicely as it appears. i think someone with a fuller figure would look very nice in this dress. sad to say that it is going back.
These pants are exactly what i expected. true to size and color were perfect! they feel so good to wear and love the detail in the sewing. perfect office attire or night out for dinner. just add a fancier blouse. ta da :)
would highly recommend them.
Love this! ordered it on sale, but i really do think it's worth full price! i went with a small even though an extra small would have been good too...i'm slender and 5'9" about 125# with full bust. the small fits similar to the model, and because i wanted it to fit well in the sleeves (i have long arms!) and length, i went with the small. maybe should have gone smaller as it is roomy! it's very well made and although you'll need a cami, i still feel as if it will be very cozy. perfect for our mi
These jeans are fantastic - the denim is very high quality and the fit is true to size. the dark rinse is very flattering and pairs well with almost anything. my only (small) gripe is that the length is a bit awkward. i'm 5'4" and it fits more like a regular pair of jeans, not ankle-length. just something to keep in mind if you're not super tall like the model in the picture.
This shirt is cute. i like the pleated neck as it makes the top feminine, while still casual. it is made of very soft fabric and drapes nicely. the only issue is that the seam/pleat that runs down the middle is off center. i think the fabric was cut incorrectly so the seam twists to one side after i have it on for a few minutes and move around. i keep having to twist it straight which is very annoying.
These run very large.  i wear a 25 or 26 in paige jeans, and the 25 in these shorts were way too big.  i fear if i got the 24 they would be a little short.
I loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on: a good cut--not too drapey or fitted. but then i washed it (laid flat to dry) and it shrunk so much that it's unwearable now. so disappointing.
