I bought this dress as a surprise for my daughter. she was very happy with it.
I love this dress! it's cotton, but thicker/ higher quality. i'm going to wear it for nights out and to dinner this summer, and it's thicker material, so i won't even have to wear a bra with it ! it's a little lower cut, so be careful. i'm 5'3 and the extra small hits me right above my ankle
I'm calling this the "gateway jumpsuit" for all those ladies who are wondering about this whole jumpsuit trend and how they feel about it--you know who you are. this jumper is flattering, comfortable, elevated--and worth trying on! i'm petite but long-waisted with curves on the bottom, which can be a tough combo when trying to find a jumper. i actually ordered the petite 2 first, which was better fitting in the waist area but i ended up ultimately purchasing the regular 2 since i preferred where
I think the shirt is supposed to be a relaxed  fit, but i could have definitely gone down a size

This top was a great find! it has a beautiful print on the front and goes perfect with my olive green shorts, capris, and pants! it is slightly sheer but not so much as to need a cami underneath. fits true to size. i love it!
This top is a nice color and soft material, but is much more of a swing top style than i was looking for. i will return it, but it could be ideal for someone who wants a very loose fitting casual look.
I received this coat today and i'm ecstatic about my purchase. i am a true petite, and the petite large in this coat fit perfectly. i was a little worried about the sizing based on the other reviews. yes, the button is low, but that is the style. i strongly suggest ordering a petite if you are short. otherwise, the fit may be completely off.
I do a lot of online shopping and, consequently, a lot of returning. when i saw this shirt online i was really excited about it - it just looks very elegant, nice and airy. when the shirt arrived, i almost thought that i should return it, because there was blue lint all over the body and sleeves. turns out that this is part of the shirt; if you zoom in, you can see the blue specs woven in. i didn't end up returning the shirt, because it's extremely comfortable, and i still get a lot of complimen
