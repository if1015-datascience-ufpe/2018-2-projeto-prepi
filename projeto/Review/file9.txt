This dress is absolutely beautiful! i love the colors and design however there are two issues with the dress for my body style: 1. it's not made for busty girls. i'm a 34d/dd and the small would have fit well (i'm 5' 6", 147 lbs.) but my chest did not fit. so i tried the medium but then the overall fit was worse, which led to another issue: 2. the waist and pleating made me look a little heavy because i still have a small amount of baby weight/spare tire around my waist, which was highlighted wi
Got these in 28 and they fit like a dream.  the best medium wash, so versatile for all seasons.   i love the rise because it sucks in my pooch.  sometimes i wear 29 or 28 in paige.  i have a wide waist, slim hips, flat bum--these jeans help me look shapelier.
Love this dress! just wore it last night to an early valentine's dinner. very classy, simple, but gorgeous. i'm a size 2 in just about everything but i always buy a size 4 in retailer dresses because i'm tall (5'9") and have broad shoulders and a long torso, and sizing up in dresses works better all around. i am also not busty (32b). i did get this in a 4. this dress was a little awkward at first trying to hook and then zip but once i got that down it worked. the hook is right up under your
This is the most perfect tunic out there. it is comfy, flattering and fits perfect. it can be dressed up or dressed down. definitely worth it to buy in every color!
I love this unique t-shirt. the fall colors and ranchers theme are perfect with skinny jeans and boots. a western look that's feminine. the shirt is very soft, ordered my usual size small, a little long but good for tucking in.

This is the perfect little shirt when you want more than an ordinary t-shirt. the pattern on the back panel adds a nice little extra touch. the blue tone is very rich looking, and could be dressed up or down.
I love sweater knit dresses and this the first one i've owned with a flare style that works. pattern placement is gorgeously done and is very slimming in a non-obvious way. i think the fabric is soft and warm. i wish the scoop neckline was a tad bit higher from a modesty standpoint. you may want to size down if you're not busty. i am 5'3" and m petite was the perfect length on me. shout out to the reno distribution center for getting this amazing dress to me in 1.5 days?!?!?!!!
An odd top.
for my curvy figure (34g), the seam did not enhance, but rather made me look wider.
the material is...interesting. foam-like is all i can think to describe it. the fabric and design are not as elegant looking in person.
This is one of those dresses that is just "nice" and can be one that you go to in a pinch.... it flows very nicely and you can dress it up and down. it's not the best quality in fabric...but if it was all silk you would have paid 3xs. i like it, it fits well...it's not outstanding or unusual. i think it is a bit pricey for what you get...but, it's a "work horse" dress...it will do you right whenever you need it to!
