This is a very lovely t-shirt, because of the color and design. it has a very nice shape as well as the sides are not just straight across. it's perfect for leaving it untucked. the petite fits really well, no too long or too short! my only complaint is the the material, while really soft is also quite thin so i'm not sure how durable it is.
Very soft, cute design, great over leggings!

This dress fits me perfect. the only complaint i have is that it was a little snug around the neck every now and then. it was a little snug getting in and out of the dress too. overall, the design is beautiful and it is definitely my new favorite.

Got this top in the blue/orange plaid. its super cute and i love the style much better than your typical straight button down plans shirt.
